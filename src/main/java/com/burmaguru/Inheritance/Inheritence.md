# Java Inheritance

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows a new class to inherit properties and methods from an existing class. It promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

## Key Concepts

- **Superclass**: The class being inherited from (also called the base class).
- **Subclass**: The class that inherits from the superclass (also called the derived class).
- **`extends` Keyword**: Used to indicate that a class is inheriting from another class.

## Syntax

```java
public class Superclass {
    // Fields and methods
}

public class Subclass extends Superclass {
    // Additional fields and methods
}
